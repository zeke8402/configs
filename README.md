# configs

## Installation
I'm using GNU stow to manage my dotfiles. I've created folders for each theme that I'll be making.
To install, simply `cd` into the theme's directory, and for each dotfile that you'd like, use stow to symlink them.

Example:
`gnu stow polybar`

# Current Theme 

## Base 16

My current setup. I love the Base 16 ocean theme, so I built my configs around it (dunst isn't done yet)

### to-do

* tag themes once complete
* set up xautolock (look i3-fancy repo)
* screen script to change back to laptop once external is gone
* login screen
* create applets for status bar volume, wifi, etc.
